## About me

age: 37 years old | xp: 13 years XP | company: Worldline | location: Tours, France

I have worked at [Worldline](//worldline.com/en-us/home.html) since 2002.
I was initialy recruited as a developer. My roles have included application manager, project manager, lead developer.
I am currently a **Software Architect** and I am member of the corporate **Expert Team**.
I am in charge of the full life cycle from conception, implementation, to providing quality and technical expertise on major projects.

My work interests are numerous but mostly about:

* **Web** in general but especially about technical aspects such as HTML5, CSS3, WebRTC, Web Component, Multi Device Web Interface.
* **Big Data**, with a focus on scalability and real time. Experimentation on NoSQL technologies.
* **Cloud** technologies. I am adept at Devops principles, Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Deployment, and relative subjects.
* **Internet of things**. As part of my day to day work, and also as my hobby, I love prototyping around many kinds of connected devices.

During my freetime I continue to develop but for **Open Source** projects. I am the project owner of [Nunux Reader](//reader.nunux.org) and [Nunux Keeper](//keeper.nunux.org).
