about: |
  I am working at [Worldline](//worldline.com/en-us/home.html) since 2002.
  Gradually developer, application manager, project manager, lead developer, I am currently a **Software Architect** and member of the corporate **Expert Team**.
  I am in charge of conception, implementation, quality and technical expertise on major projects.

  My work interests are numerous but mostly about:

  * **Web** in general but especially about technical aspects such as HTML5, CSS3, WebRTC, Web Component, Multi Device Web Interface.
  * **Big Data**, with a focus on scalability and real time. Experimentation around NoSQL technologies.
  * **Cloud** technologies. I am a adept of Devops principles, Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Deployment, and relative subjects.
  * **Internet of things**. As my day to day work, and also as my hobby, I love prototyping around many kind of connected device.

  During my freetime I continue to develop but for **Open Source** projects. I am the project owner of [Nunux Reader](//reader.nunux.org) and [Nunux Keeper](//keeper.nunux.org).
